# jenkins-translation-tool

CLI to generate missing translation keys and missing properties files and remove
unused keys for a given language.

This is a fork from the original Perl script `translation-tool.pl` available at
the [official Jenkins project](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins).

## Install

There are several ways to install Perl modules, all very well documented by
the community. Those external dependencies are all Perl modules available at
[CPAN](https://metacpan.org/).

Here is a list of ways to do it:

1. Install with [cpan](https://metacpan.org/dist/CPAN/view/scripts/cpan#SYNOPSIS) CLI and [local::lib](https://metacpan.org/pod/local::lib).
2. Install [perlbrew](https://perlbrew.pl/), install your personal `perl` then use `cpan` CLI.
3. Install modules as root using `cpan` CLI: worst and not recommended method.

## Development details

### Dependencies

See the `Makefile.PL` file for `TEST_REQUIRES` and `PREREQ_PM` entries.

### Testing

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the tests available for this
module:

```
prove -lvm
```

Here is a sample:

```
$ prove -lvm
t/Jenkins-i18n.t ....
1..1
ok 1 - use Jenkins::i18n;
ok
t/removed_unused.t ..
1..15
ok 1 - dies without file parameter
ok 2 - get the expected error message
ok 3 - dies without keys parameter
ok 4 - get the expected error message
ok 5 - dies with invalid keys parameter
ok 6 - get the expected error message
# Without a license
ok 7 - got the expected number of keys removed
ok 8 - resulting properties file has the expected number of lines
ok 9 - dies with invalid license parameter
ok 10 - get the expected error message
# Restoring file
# With a license
ok 11 - got the expected number of keys removed
ok 12 - resulting properties file has the expected number of lines
# Restoring file
# With a backup
ok 13 - got the expected number of keys removed
ok 14 - resulting properties file has the expected number of lines
ok 15 - File has a backup as expected
ok
All tests successful.
Files=2, Tests=16,  0 wallclock secs ( 0.02 usr  0.00 sys +  0.14 cusr  0.01 csys =  0.17 CPU)
